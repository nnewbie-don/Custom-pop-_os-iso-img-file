Custom ubuntu iso img file with all necessities
I am creating the best out of the box experience for ubuntu by using cubic natively in an ubuntu dekstop environment.
Feel free to give me feedbacks on things you would want me to install. Or if you want me to make a video editor focused or gaming focused version of the ISO.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm an ordinary linux enthusiast  who is really interested in learning the most about different distros and how they work
My github profile is nnewbie_don.
The projects are are alreade public  but I am not done with anything yet.


## Installation

Download the ISO image file and flash it onto a medium of your choice. Just like you would do on any normal ubuntu installation.
Flash it using balena etcher or rufus your choice.
If you are on linux you can use anything, my personal favourite is popsicle iso img flasher or whatever it is called.
